## Notes about the dataset that we need to finalize the format:

- Car Details v3
 - In the Mileage column, some of the values are listed as km/kg 
 - Lots of NULL values, we might need to delete those blank rows.
 - In the Torque column, some values used "at" text, but most of them used the "@" symbol. Also, some of them used "kgm", but 90% of them used Nm.
 - We might need to combine Trustmark dealer with the Dealer values in the Seller Type column to reduce the unique values in the dataset.
