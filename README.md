# Car Dekho - Selling Price Prediction
## Project Overview
### Selected topic
This project will use data from Car Dekho, an online vehicle marketplace, to train a machine learning model to predict a car's selling price based on features in the data including vehicle year, mileage, and fuel type.

### Why this topic?
Pricing a car can feel like more of an art than a science when using a naive human estimation approach, so this seems like a perfect opportunity to leverage machine learning. This dataset is also relatively generic in terms of the data provided for each vehicle, making it extendible if later we want to increase the size of the training data by adding records from other online vehicle marketplaces.

### Questions to investigate
What are the most significant factors that determine a car's value? Do cars that use diesel fuel lose value more quickly as vehicle mileage increases?

## Technologies Used
### Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas will be used to clean the data. All data manipulation will be performed in Python.

### Machine Learning
SciKit-Learn's linear regression model package will be used to create a machine learning model.

### Data Storage
PostgreSQL will be used to host the tables of the database.

## Communication Protocols
The team will correspond over Slack, in addition to meeting over Zoom as needed when possible. Also team decided to meet every sunday to make sure that we are all ready to go for the next week.


## The following Link will be our Google Slides for the presentation purpose

The slides will be updated every segment as needed
