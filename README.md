# Car Dekho - Selling Price Prediction
## Overview
### Selected topic
This project will use data from Car Dekho, an online vehicle marketplace, to train a machine learning model to predict a car's selling price based on features in the data including vehicle year, mileage, and fuel type.

### Why this topic?
Pricing a car can feel like more of an art than a science when using a naive human estimation approach, so this seems like a perfect opportunity to leverage machine learning. This dataset is also relatively generic in terms of the data provided for each vehicle, making it extendible if later we want to increase the size of the training data by adding records from other online vehicle marketplaces.

### Questions to investigate
What are the most significant factors that determine a car's value? Do cars that use diesel fuel lose value more quickly as vehicle mileage increases?

## Communication Protocols
The team will correspond over Slack, in addition to meeting over Zoom as needed when possible.
